# Password Generator

Random password generator that allows users to make selections to customize their password. Prompts request that users choose whether or not to have: letters (uppercase and/or lowercase), numbers, and special characters. The last prompt requests that users choose a number from 8 to 128 to select their password length. If users ignore the first four prompts, they are forced back to first prompt. If users choose a number outside of the range or choose a non-number, users are presented with an alert and must make a new selection. Randomly generated password displays in page center.
